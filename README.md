# oceanNext-multiMarkdownComposer
Color Profile for use with MultiMarkdown Composer adapting the Ocean Next color scheme.

I designed this theme adapting the OceanNext color scheme for use with MultiMarkdown Composer. To use the theme, simply copy the .theme file to your Themes Folder. You can access the folder by pulling up your preferences dialog and clicking on the "Open Themes Folder" button under the "Appearance" tab.

Of note, this theme makes use of italic font styles, and I designed it with the Victor Mono font in mind. However, it's not required, of course.
